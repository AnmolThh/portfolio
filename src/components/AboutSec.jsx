          About Me...
        </h1>
        <p className="text-secondary text-sm">
          Iâ€™m a creative technologist currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer
          Science at Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology. My passion lies in
          building clean, thoughtful, and purposeful digital experiences that
          bridge design and development. <br /> <br /> With a strong foundation
          in both frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy crafting user
          interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also functionally
          efficient. Whether it's a sleek portfolio or a full-stack application,
          I approach every project with curiosity, intention, and a deep
          attention to detail. <br />
          <br /> I believe in the power of minimalism, meaningful interaction,
          and continuous learning. Outside of code, I enjoy experimenting with
          design, exploring motion graphics, and working on real-world projects
          that make an impact.
